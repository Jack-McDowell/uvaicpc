To check the number of pairs that have the same result when divided by the given quotient, 
but aren't at the same index in the given list, we just have to determine the total number 
of items for each result. 

Once we have this, we can count the number of unique pairs for each result and sum them up.
To count the number of unique pairs for n items, use the formula:
	(n * (n - 1)) / 2
