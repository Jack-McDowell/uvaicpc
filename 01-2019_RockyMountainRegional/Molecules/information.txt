The important thing is to notice that for each dimension, you have N unknowns. This means that if you can create N different linear relationships, you can row reduce to explicitly find all N locations. This works because the problem guarantees that a valid configuration will exist. My code uses Gaussian elimination to tow reduce which is O(n^3) complexity.
