# UVa ICPC Student Practice Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains solutions written by students at the University of Virginia to programming problems. These problems are from our weekly practice for the Inter-Collegiate Programming Contest. The contents of this repository are meant to be useful study and practice materials.

## People

Our ICPC team is currently managed by the following people:

- Faculty:
	- Mark Floryan ([email](mailto:mrf8t@virginia.edu))
	- Nathan Brunelle ([email](mailto:njb2b@virginia.edu))

- Students:
	- Kelvin ([email](mailto:kelvinwpeng@gmail.com))
	- Will Mayes ([email](mailto:wtm4bp@virginia.edu))

## Folder Structure

Each folder in this repository has the following folder structure: \[Practice Number\]-\[year of original contest\]_\[Name of contest\]. For example, the folder "01-2019_RockyMountainRegional" is from our first practice of the year (01) and the contest was the Rocky Mountain Regional problems from 2019.



## Submitting Problems

We only accept pull requests from students at UVa, submitting work done through our ICPC practice sessions. The process for doing this is:

- Solve the problem using any program language. However, we much prefer Python3, C++, or Java (the languages accepted during our regional ICPC contests).

- Create a folder under the proper contest / practice. Your folder must include the following:
	- A text file called *information.txt" which contains:
		- Name and email of the submitter (so peers can contact you with questions). *Optional, but encouraged.*
		- A link to the Kattis submission page for the problem (if applicable)
		- A short summary (5-6 sentences) describing the overall approach to your solution.
	- The code for that problem.

- Submit a pull request for your submission and let UVa ICPC staff know. Current staff members are above.
